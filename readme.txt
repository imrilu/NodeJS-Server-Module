Ex3 - Internet Technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) What was hard in this ex?
Alot of things. first of all, I wasn't used at-all to this kind of "learning-routine". In 
a good way - it helped me learn how to learn and be able to "hack" stuff from different 
places on the web. The real challenge was to get a grasp on the high-level perspective
and how each component work and why (request, response, next).

(2) What was fun in this ex?
The intensive work needed for the exercise. in a good way. yeah.

(3) How did you test your server?
We tested the server on WebStorm localhost server debugger. We inserted different kind of
mw to the server and tried to execute them.
